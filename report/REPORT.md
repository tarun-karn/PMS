## 5. Abstract

The **Placement Management System (PlaceMe)** is a full-stack web application designed to digitize and streamline the campus placement process in educational institutions. The system addresses the limitations of traditional manual placement management by providing a centralized platform where administrators can manage companies, create placement drives, and track student applications, while students can browse available opportunities, apply to placement drives based on eligibility criteria, and monitor their application status in real-time.

The application is built using the **MERN stack** — MongoDB Atlas for the database, Express.js for the backend API, React.js for the frontend interface, and Node.js as the runtime. The database schema follows a robust design derived from an Entity-Relationship (ER) model consisting of five collections: Students, Admins, Companies, Drives, and Applications. The system implements **JWT-based authentication**, **role-based access control** (student and admin roles), **CGPA-based eligibility filtering**, and **application status tracking** (pending, shortlisted, selected, rejected). The frontend features a modern **Neobrutalism UI** design aesthetic. The system is deployable on **Vercel** for both frontend and backend.

## 6. Introduction

### 6.1 Background / Motivation

Campus placements are a critical milestone in every student's academic journey. In most institutions, the placement process is managed manually — using spreadsheets, notice boards, WhatsApp groups, and paper-based records. This leads to several problems:
- Students miss important placement announcements and deadlines.
- Administrators struggle to track which students applied to which company.
- There is no centralized record of application statuses and placement outcomes.
- Eligibility filtering (CGPA, branch) is done manually and is error-prone.

The motivation behind this project was to build a digital platform that automates and organizes the entire placement lifecycle — from company registration and drive creation to student applications and result tracking.

### 6.2 Problem Definition

Design and develop a **Database Management System-based web application** that:
1. Manages student registrations and profiles.
2. Allows administrators to create and manage companies and placement drives.
3. Enables students to browse drives, check eligibility, and apply.
4. Tracks application status (pending → shortlisted → selected/rejected).
5. Provides dashboards with real-time statistics for both students and administrators.

### 6.3 Objectives

1. Design a normalized database schema using ER modeling for a placement management system.
2. Implement a secure authentication system with role-based access (student/admin).
3. Build CRUD operations for all entities (students, companies, drives, applications).
4. Implement eligibility-based filtering (minimum CGPA criteria for placement drives).
5. Develop an intuitive, modern web interface for both students and administrators.
6. Deploy the system on a cloud platform (Vercel) for remote accessibility.

## 7. Literature Survey / Existing System

### 7.1 Existing Systems

| System | Description | Limitations |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Manual System (Spreadsheets)** | Most colleges use Excel/Google Sheets to manage placement data. | No automation, error-prone, no real-time updates, no student-facing interface. |
| **Superset/ERP Modules** | Some institutions use ERP-based placement modules. | Expensive, complex, not tailored for placement-specific workflows. |
| **WhatsApp/Email** | Ad-hoc communication channels for placement updates. | No structured data, no application tracking, notifications get lost. |
| **Third-party platforms (Internshala, LinkedIn)** | Used by companies directly. | Not institution-specific, no admin control over eligibility or selection process. |

### 7.2 Gaps Identified

1. **No centralized database** — Student data, company data, and application data exist in silos.
2. **No automated eligibility filtering** — Admins manually verify CGPA and branch for each applicant.
3. **No real-time status tracking** — Students have no way to check their application status.
4. **No analytics/dashboard** — No overview of placement statistics for administrators.
5. **No role-based access** — Security concerns when all data is accessible to everyone.

### 7.3 Our Contribution

We designed and built a complete, purpose-built Placement Management System that addresses all the identified gaps using modern web technologies and robust DBMS concepts (ER modeling, normalization, indexing, referential integrity).

## 8. Proposed System

### 8.1 System Overview

The Placement Management System ("PlaceMe") is a role-based web application with two user types:
- **Admin** — Manages companies, placement drives, and views/processes student applications.
- **Student** — Registers, browses drives, applies to eligible drives, and tracks application status.

### 8.2 Features / Scope

**Student Features:**
- Registration and login with secure authentication
- Personal dashboard with placement statistics
- Browse available placement drives with filter options
- View drive details (position, CTC, location, skills, selection procedure)
- Apply to drives (auto-checks CGPA eligibility and deadlines)
- Track application status (pending/shortlisted/selected/rejected)
- Update profile and resume link

**Admin Features:**
- Admin dashboard with comprehensive statistics (students, companies, drives, applications, selected, pending)
- Full CRUD for companies (create, read, update, delete)
- Full CRUD for placement drives (linked to companies)
- View applicants per drive with student details (name, email, CGPA, branch, resume)
- Update application status directly from the applicants table
- Browse all registered students

## 11. Conclusion and Future Scope

### 11.1 Summary of Achievements

The Placement Management System (PlaceMe) was successfully developed as a comprehensive DBMS-based web application that addresses the challenges of manual placement management. Key achievements include:

1. **Designed a robust ER model** with 4 entities (Student, Admin, Company, Placement Drive) and 3 relationships, including an M:N junction collection (Applications) with status tracking.
2. **Implemented a full REST API** with 20+ endpoints covering authentication, CRUD operations, and business logic (eligibility checks, deadline validation, duplicate prevention).
3. **Built a modern, responsive frontend** with Neobrutalism UI theme, 13 pages, and role-based navigation.
4. **Deployed on cloud infrastructure** (MongoDB Atlas for database, Vercel for hosting) ensuring scalability and remote accessibility.
5. **Applied core DBMS concepts**: ER modeling, normalization, indexing (unique compound index on applications), referential integrity (ObjectId references), and aggregation.

### 11.2 Limitations

1. Resume upload is URL-based only; no file upload support.
2. No email notifications for application status changes.
3. No advanced search or filter by branch/skill on the drives page.
4. No bulk status update for applicants.
5. No data export feature (e.g., download placement report as CSV/PDF).

### 11.3 Future Scope

1. **File Upload** — Integrate cloud storage (Cloudinary/AWS S3) for resume uploads.
2. **Email Notifications** — Send automated emails when application status changes.
3. **Advanced Filtering** — Add branch-based and skill-based filtering for drives.
4. **Analytics Dashboard** — Add charts and graphs for placement trends (placement rate, top companies, branch-wise statistics).
5. **Interview Scheduling** — Add a scheduling module for interview slots.
6. **Mobile App** — Develop a React Native mobile application.
7. **Bulk Operations** — Allow admins to bulk-select/reject applicants.
8. **PDF Reports** — Generate downloadable placement reports.
9. **Company Portal** — Add a third role allowing companies to directly post drives and manage their own applicants.

  // Deadline check
  if (drive.deadline && new Date(drive.deadline) < new Date())
    return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Application deadline has passed' });

  // CGPA eligibility check
  const student = await Student.findById(req.user.id);
  if (drive.minCGPA && student.cgpa < drive.minCGPA)
    return res.status(400).json({ message: `Minimum CGPA of ${drive.minCGPA} required` });

  // Duplicate check
  const existing = await Application.findOne({ student: req.user.id, drive: driveId });
  if (existing) return res.status(400).json({ message: 'Already applied' });
